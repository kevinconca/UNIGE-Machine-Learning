Classification is one of the most widely used techniques in machine learning with a broad scope of applications, including spam detection, image classification, medical diagnostic and risk assessment. The main goal is to predict a certain class $y$ from a set of inputs $X$. Linear classifiers are amongst the most practical classification methods.

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and gradient descent are the most widely known approaches for linear classification. Nonetheless, this lab requires manual design, meaning that none of these mentioned approaches is used \cite{classification}.
